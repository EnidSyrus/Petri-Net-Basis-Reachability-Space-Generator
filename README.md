# Petri-Net-Basis-Reachability-Space-Generator
Petri Net Basis Reachability Space Generator (PBSG) is a software for the computation of the basis reachability graph of a Petri net. PBSG has been developed in the Lab of Systems Control & Automation, a research group of School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University. 
The detailed description of the functions and specific usage of the software can be found in 'User_Quick_Guide', where we also provide some basics of Petri Nets as well as the technical references of the Basis Reachability Graph and basis markings.
