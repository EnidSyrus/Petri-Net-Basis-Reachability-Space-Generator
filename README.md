# Petri-Net-Basis-Reachability-Space-Generator
Petri Net Basis Reachability Space Generator (PBSG) is a software for the computation of the basis reachability graph of a Petri net. PBSG has been developed in the Lab of Systems Control & Automation, a research group of School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University. 

The detailed description of the functions and specific usage of the software can be found in 'User Quick Guide.pdf' (or click 'Help' --> 'User Quick Guide' on the upper left corner of the software interface), where we also provide some basics of Petri Nets as well as the technical references of the Basis Reachability Graph and basis markings.

For testing, here we also provide the input files of an example (the Net in '.txt' and '.ndr' form respectively) in the corresponding folder 'txt example' and 'ndr example'.
